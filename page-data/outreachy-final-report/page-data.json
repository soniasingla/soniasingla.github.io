I am always bad at leaving and it’s really the bittersweet moment. The past three months, will always be the most beautiful time of my life.</p>\n<p>I did my internship with <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility\">WebCompat</a> team and I am missing working with Dennis terribly. Since, Mozilla is a global non-profit with a strong community that works openly, I’ll be working as Volunteer Contributor 👩‍💻</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/\">Outreachy</a> is more than an internship to me. I was never confident about myself, even I was afraid to apply for an internship (I am the luckiest, I did 😌). One of the most important thing that this internship boosts up my self-confident. I am no one afraid to learn new technologies, apply for internships and jobs.</p>\n<p>Dennis, my <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/\">Outreachy</a> mentor has big hand in helping me out through-out the journey. We used to have weekly video call and meetings often. He actually taught me how to write well-structured and quality code. During the internship period, I got a chance to met amazing folks in Mozilla Community, people from other communities, and also made few new friends 🤗</p>\n<p>Now this internship has been ended, what next? 🤔 After completing my graduation(which is supposed to be completed in May 2021), I want to switch country, looking for new opportunities.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I want to say thanks to <a href=\"https://www.outreachy.org/\">Outreachy</a> Program, Mozilla, and to my mentor, <a href=\"https://schub.wtf/\">Dennis Schubert</a> ❤️</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Outreachy Internship with Mozilla - Final Report","date":"March 17, 2020","description":"I did my internship with WebCompat team and I am missing working with Dennis terribly.
