So, I‚Äôll start with the short-definition of <code class=\"language-text\">Web Compatibility</code> : Web Compatibility is the <strong>compatibility</strong> or <strong>flexibility</strong> of a website, web application, script or HTML design to function on different web browsers available. Different browsers read the website code differently and differs in the way in which a web page looks in different web browsers.</p>\n<p>Across browsers, the web-form at webcompat.com is the primary source of web compatibility reports, but the team also manages <code class=\"language-text\">web compatibility reporter</code> module for Firefox. It offers various advantages as it‚Äôs easier to access, gathers more information about the issue, resulting, the fast-processing on that particular issue üôÇ</p>\n<p>The reporter is implemented as a standalone Web-extension, that leverages both standard Web-extension APIs as well as some Firefox-specific APIs that allows gathering more information, like taking a screenshot and collecting error messages from the JavaScript error console.</p>\n<p>If you want to contribute in Web Compatibility team of Mozilla, check the GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>The various different projects are enlisted on the above mentioned repository.
