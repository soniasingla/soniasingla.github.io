So, I’ll start with the short-definition of <code class=\"language-text\">Web Compatibility</code> : Web Compatibility is the <strong>compatibility</strong> or <strong>flexibility</strong> of a website, web application, script or HTML design to function on different web browsers available. Different browsers read the website code differently and differs in the way in which a web page looks in different web browsers.</p>\n<p>Across browsers, the web-form at webcompat.com is the primary source of web compatibility reports, but the team also manages <code class=\"language-text\">web compatibility reporter</code> module for Firefox. It offers various advantages as it’s easier to access, gathers more information about the issue, resulting, the fast-processing on that particular issue 🙂</p>\n<p>The reporter is implemented as a standalone Web-extension, that leverages both standard Web-extension APIs as well as some Firefox-specific APIs that allows gathering more information, like taking a screenshot and collecting error messages from the JavaScript error console.</p>\n<p>If you want to contribute in Web Compatibility team of Mozilla, check the GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>The various different projects are enlisted on the above mentioned repository. If you want to contribute in any other Mozilla’s project, you can check <a href=\"codetribute.mozilla.org\">this</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>“We grow because we struggle, we learn and overcome.”</h2>\n<center><b>Hit me up if you need any help, happy to help you 🙂</b></center>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project workflow with Web Compatibility team of Mozilla","date":"January 15, 2020","description":"The reporter is implemented as a standalone Web-extension, that leverages both standard Web-extension APIs as well as some Firefox-specific APIs that allows gathering more information, like taking a screenshot and collecting error messages from the JavaScript error console."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/outreachy-project-workflow/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/everybody-struggles/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Everybody Struggles"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/review-2019-goals-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My 2019 in review and Goals for 2020"}}}}}
