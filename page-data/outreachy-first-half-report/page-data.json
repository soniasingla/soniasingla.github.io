We are half way done ! But eh, I donâ€™t want to end it, I am enjoying every part of this internship. In this, I am prototyping the next version of our in-browser reporting component in the form of web-extension.</p>\n<p>With the help of my mentor, <a href=\"https://schub.wtf/\">Dennis</a>, we divided the task into small steps : easy to manage, develop and gain clear understanding of the concepts involved with the coding side. On the start of this internship, I thought Iâ€™ll complete the basic prototyping till January but a lot has to be done and it will go long way. When we develop a new tool, write code for different functionalities, test them, handle the various scenarios involved, the formatting, it feels the tool will never be ready. It is bittersweet but when i look behind, it feels the sense of achievement.</p>\n<p>I had weekly zoom meeting with my mentor and the <a href=\"https://github.com/webcompat\">Webcompat</a> team, where we focused and discussed to change the next steps a bit, re-prioritize the tasks, and make more progress on one task while cutting down on some things. During Christmas holidays, I spent most of time on researching and trying to implement advanced features that I could add to my extension tool. But that should be not be the initial task. It is important to learn how to re-prioritize the tasks otherwise you will be busy whole day but get nothing done.</p>\n<p>Probably not as I planned or imagined, but it will work ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>Currently, I am working on refactoring of code/writing more clean code : restructuring existing code, changing the factoring without changing itâ€™s external behavior. It serves lot many advantages that include improved code readability, reduced complexity and source-code maintainability. Refactoring is a lot like solving a Rubikâ€™s cube. There are lots of little steps required to achieve a large goal. Each step enables the next.</p>\n<p>I code <a href=\"https://github.com/soniasingla/\">@soniasingla</a> and tweet at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soniasinglas\">@soniasinglas</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Progress Report - First half of Outreachy Internship","date":"February 03, 2020","description":"Currently, I am working on refactoring of code/writing more clean code : restructuring existing code, changing the factoring without changing itâ€™s external behavior."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/outreachy-first-half-report/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/review-2019-goals-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My 2019 in review and Goals for 2020"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/experience-mozilla-rep/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Experience as a Mozilla Rep"}}}}}
