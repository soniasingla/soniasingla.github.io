They also explained me about the <strong>LTS (Long Term Storage)</strong> course, how it works and provided me some good issues to start with to have good understanding of the code base.</p>\n<h2>WORK DONE :</h2>\n<p><img src=\"./workdone.gif\" alt=\"Thanos Project\"></p>\n<center><sub>WORK DONE</sub></center><br/>\n<p>During the past first week, I worked on automating the TOC (Table of Content) on pages having more than 400 words. <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> can automatically parse Markdown content and create a Table of Contents which we can use in our templates. The following is a partial template(smaller, context-aware components) that adds slightly more logic for page-level control over TOC (Table of Contents).</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\">{{ if and (gt .WordCount 400 ) (.Params.toc) }}\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>aside</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>header</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>h2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>{{.Title}}<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>h2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>header</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    {{.TableOfContents}}\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>aside</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n{{ end }}</code></pre></div>\n<p>For more details, you can visit the site <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/content-management/toc/#template-example-toc-partial\">here</a>.
