Sometimes I felt how stupid questions am asking, a feeling of inferiority, fear and hesitation got developed within me. I used to keep myself underrated. Moreover, once I got so frustrated, I just chucked my laptop.</p>\n<h2>Happened with you, also?</h2>\n<p>We might think sometimes <code class=\"language-text\">I am unable to understand my own code, how am I supposed to read and then make changes to someone else‚Äôs code ?</code> Until last year, the same thing goes in my mind, too. Reading and understanding someone‚Äôs else code and writing your own code on top of that can be a daunting task, but with the right resources and guidelines, it is not as difficult as we might think.</p>\n<p>Before stepping ahead into open-source, we should atleast know any programming language and have working knowledge of GitHub. Once you start making efforts, be more mindful to your activities, the more appreciation and results could be discovered. I don‚Äôt want to tire you people by telling the definition of open-source and all. Go-ahead and search by yourself üôÇ</p>\n<p>The first open-source project with which I started the contribution is <a href=\"https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger\">Debugger</a> from <a href=\"https://github.com/firefox-devtools\">Firefox Devtools</a>üî•ü¶äüõ†</p>\n<p>A brief explanation about project : <a href=\"https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger\">Debugger</a> is a hackable debugger for modern times, built from the ground up using <code class=\"language-text\">React</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Redux</code>. It is designed to be approachable, yet powerful. And it is engineered to be predictable, understandable, and testable. Mozilla created this debugger for use in the Firefox Developer tools.</p>\n<p>There‚Äôs ton of things that I like about the Mozilla Community. Being a beginner, we need proper guidance and help from the community on how to get involved and perform certain tasks, that could be best extracted from Mozilla. I felt the people in this community are not only contributing to the development of their own but others too.</p>\n<p>For more detailed Information, visit the <a href=\"https://github.com/firefox-devtools\">site</a></p>\n<center><sub>Debugger Project</sub></center>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/914c7/Invoice_10953835549.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 78.37837837837837%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Debugger Project\"\n        title=\"Debugger Project\"\n        src=\"/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/fcda8/Invoice_10953835549.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/12f09/Invoice_10953835549.png 148w,\n/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/e4a3f/Invoice_10953835549.png 295w,\n/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/fcda8/Invoice_10953835549.png 590w,\n/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/efc66/Invoice_10953835549.png 885w,\n/static/3006cfed17784c9e083eb0de52523c30/914c7/Invoice_10953835549.png 978w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>If you need any help or want to ask any question, shoot mail at <strong>soniasingla.1812@gmail.com</strong> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/soniasinglas\">twitter</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Best Wishes and Happy Coding üòâ</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Open-Source Beginnings with Mozilla","date":"January 07, 2019","description":"There are years that ask questions and years that answer."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/open-source-beginnings-mozilla/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/localization-with-pontoon/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"LOCALIZATION WITH PONTOON - DIVE INTO OPEN-SOURCE"}}}}}
