The theme for this week in **Outreachy** is `Think About Your Audience`. So I’m currently thinking about you 😉

We are provided with some goals and another amazing task to write blog post about elucidating the project in which we are interned.

I repeat, am working as Mozilla Web Compatibility Intern in this [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Program.

If you want to know more about [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and how to get involved, read my old blog posts 🙂

In this blog post, I am going to talk about my project : **Prototype an in-browser mechanism to report web compatibility issues**. So, I’ll start with the short-definition of `Web Compatibility` : Web Compatibility is the **compatibility** or **flexibility** of a website, web application, script or HTML design to function on different web browsers available. Different browsers read the website code differently and differs in the way in which a web page looks in different web browsers.

Across browsers, the web-form at webcompat.com is the primary source of web compatibility reports, but the team also manages `web compatibility reporter` module for Firefox. It offers various advantages as it’s easier to access, gathers more information about the issue, resulting, the fast-processing on that particular issue 🙂

The reporter is implemented as a standalone Web-extension, that leverages both standard Web-extension APIs as well as some Firefox-specific APIs that allows gathering more information, like taking a screenshot and collecting error messages from the JavaScript error console.
