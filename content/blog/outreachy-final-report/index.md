Today is my last day being an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/). I am always bad at leaving and it’s really the bittersweet moment. The past three months, will always be the most beautiful time of my life.

I did my internship with [WebCompat](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility) team and I am missing working with Dennis terribly. Since, Mozilla is a global non-profit with a strong community that works openly, I’ll be working as Volunteer Contributor 👩‍💻

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is more than an internship to me. I was never confident about myself, even I was afraid to apply for an internship (I am the luckiest, I did 😌). One of the most important thing that this internship boosts up my self-confident. I am no one afraid to learn new technologies, apply for internships and jobs.

Dennis, my [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) mentor has big hand in helping me out through-out the journey. We used to have weekly video call and meetings often. He actually taught me how to write well-structured and quality code. During the internship period, I got a chance to met amazing folks in Mozilla Community, people from other communities, and also made few new friends 🤗

Now this internship has been ended, what next? 🤔 After completing my graduation(which is supposed to be completed in May 2021), I want to switch country, looking for new opportunities.

Lastly, I want to say thanks to [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) Program, Mozilla, and to my mentor, [Dennis Schubert](https://schub.wtf/) ❤️
