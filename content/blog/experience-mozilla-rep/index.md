I joined this program last year and many of you might donâ€™t know about Mozilla Reps Program, check the [website](https://reps.mozilla.org/). The Mozilla Reps program is open to anyone who is passionate, knowledgeable and willing to help.

Under the on-boarding process, we took few workshops, organized hackathon and also, interacted with many people online. In the starting phase, very few people knew about Mozilla, their open-source programs, manifesto and products. It was good to see that many people joined the workshop and were eager to learn.

I organized few events and if anyone wants to know more about the events, they can check [here](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/soniasingla/).

It is a good experience till now, and am looking forward to organize more events in future, make connections with fellow reps and teach the world ðŸ™‚
